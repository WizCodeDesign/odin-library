# odin-library<br><br>
This is an Odin Project where the user can build his own library of books(Max 8 books on the shelf), the user can enter the book's title, number of pages, and it's read status(read the book, reading it, or unread). They can also clear the shelf of all books.<br>

Things to improve in the future :<br>
<ul>
    <li>Add a tooltip cloud that shows a books info when the user clicks / hovers on it.</li><br>
    <li>Allow the user to remove / take one book on clicking it after choosing the Take Book option using a button</li>
    </ul>

NOTE : I actually enjoyed this project quite a lot, unexpectedly.
